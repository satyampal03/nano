// Steven needs a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes to eat in a restaurant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.

// Your tasks:

// Calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called tip for this. It's not allowed to use an if...else statement (if it's easier for you, you can start with an if...else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary operator).

// Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value (bill + tip).


// Note: Use the values of the bill and tip variables to construct this string. Don't hard-code them 🙂

// TEST DATA: Test with different bill values: 275, 40, and 430

// HINT: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2

// HINT 2: Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300 😉



// 👋 OPTIONAL: You can watch my solution in video format in the next lecture


//---------------------------
// resturant jbb jata hai to uska bill 50-300 ke bich me hota hai to wo 15% off leta hai

// agar bill value 50-300 ke bich me nhi hota hai to h wo 20% off leta hai

// task to calculate tip !Create a variable called 'tip' for this

// Print a string to the console containing the bill value, ( Example: The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 316.25.

// solution 

let bill =245;

let tip = (bill >= 50 && bill <= 300) ?15 :20;

let total = tip + bill;

if(tip === 15){
    console.log(`The  Bill  was ${bill}, the tip was ${tip}, and the total value ${total}`)
}
